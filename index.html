<p>I was going to make a game browser but that didn't workout as I wanted to. So instead I'm going to explain how to play Uno.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Get friends to play Uno with you. You need at least you and another person. If you have no friends then you have no Uno. Get a friend.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Get the Uno card deck, then shuffle the cards and hand 7 cards to each person face down. Only the person with the cards can look at them.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>After dealing the cards out you put the remaining stack in the middle and flip one card over face up next to the deck.</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Now the youngest player will look in their hand to see if they have a card that either matches the number or color on the card. So if the card in the middle is a red 5 and the player has a green 5 they may put the card down. But if that player doesn't have a card that matches they must pick up a card from the face down deck until they get one that does match with the face up card. </p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<p>Now when the player is finished putting down the card the person to their left goes. And so on. Just beware of the special cards like a skip, reverse, draw +2, wild, or draw +4. Each of the cards have different uses.</p>
<p>Special Cards:</p>
<p>The skip is used to skip the next persons turn. A reverse is used is to reverse the direction people take their turn. For instance if peoples turns are going clockwise then a person puts down a reverse the person to the right goes and thats the new direction of peoples turns. Next is the Draw +2. When a player uses a draw +2 card the person after them has to pick up 2 cards and skips their turn or if that player has a draw +2 card of their own they may put down the card to pass it on to the next person and so on. There is also wild cards. These cards have the four different colors found on different cards and this is to change to color that everyone is putting down. All you do is say the color your picking on the card after putting it in the pile of cards facing up. This does count as your turn. Lastly is the draw +4 card. This card is a wild and you make the necxt player pick up 4 cards on top of changing the color to anything you want. Also if you have a draw +4 card place towards you, you can place one down on top and make the next player pick up 8 cards.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to be the first player to have no cards left. But when you get to one card left you have to shout Uno. If you don't call Uno before another player calls it then you must pick up 2 cards.</p>
